# It Is Unique Official – Image Placeholder Service

> 🌐 *img.itisuniqueofficial.com* – formerly our public image-placeholder service

Hello there!  
Welcome to the GitHub profile repository for **It Is Unique Official**’s placeholder-image project. Below you’ll find an overview of our service, its status, and what this repository represents.

## 🚀 Service Overview

For a time, we provided an easy-to-use image placeholder service at **img.itisuniqueofficial.com**.  
Users could request image URLs of custom size, colour, text & format, to quickly mock-up designs or fill in visuals while developing their projects.

---

## ❗ Service Status: Discontinued

As of **October 25, 2025**, this service has been officially shut down.  
- Due to increasing hosting costs.  
- Due to higher maintenance overhead.  
- And insufficient user/support engagement to justify continuation.

We sincerely thank all the developers, designers and users who used the service over the years.

## 🗂 What this Repository Contains

- This profile repository lives at `iiuo-img/.github/profile/README.md`, purely to serve as our GitHub org’s landing page.  
- There are no active code updates or deployment workflows tied to this service anymore.  
- The service endpoints are no longer operational; any previously embedded placeholders will no longer resolve.

## 🕰 Historical Note & Why You Might See Legacy Usage

If you still spot `img.itisuniqueofficial.com` links in old documentation, design mock-ups or published sites:  
- They likely point to images that will **not load** anymore.  
- Consider replacing them with alternative placeholder services (e.g., [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com), [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos), or self-hosted solutions).  
- We recommend updating your projects to avoid broken image links.
